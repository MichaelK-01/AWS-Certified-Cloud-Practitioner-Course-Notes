# AWS-Certified-Cloud-Practitioner-Course-Notes
## Personal notes for the Cloud Guru AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Course

AWS Certifications are the hottest certifications in IT for the third year in a row. This constantly evolving cloud computing platform offers a wide selection of services that can drive innovation, enable scalability, and help your organization maximize its IT spend.

The Certified Cloud Practitioner prep course by Cloud Guru was designed for non-technical personnel in sales, support, and managerial roles who need to understand AWS at a high level, but donâ€™t need to know each service on a technical level.

The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification will allow me to better interact with developers and other IT professionals engaged in AWS-related projects. Secondly, earning this credential will be my first step toward the more technical AWS Associate-level certifications.

As part of this course, there will be three hands on labs. These hands-on labs will bridge the theory knowledge and real skills. The labs will be based on real-world scenarios in real cloud environments that will allow me to practice what I have learned. This course will contain the following three labs:
1. Launching an EC2 instance in a Custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) 
2. Creating a Lambda Function Using the AWS Console
3. Managing AWS IAM User Permissions Using Groups and Policies
