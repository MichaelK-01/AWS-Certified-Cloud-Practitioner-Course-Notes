# Identity Access Management Best Practices

1. **Root Account:** Only use the root account to create the AWS account. Do not use it to log in.
1. **Users:** 1 user should equal 1 real human. Do not create phantom users.
1. **Users/Groups/Policies:** Always place users in groups, and then apply policies to the groups. This makes management easier.
1. **Password Policies:** Have a strong password rotation policy.
1. **Multi-factor Authentication:** Always enable MFA wherever possible.
1. **Roles:** Use roles to access various other AWS services.
1. **Access Keys:** Use access keys for programmatic access to AWS.
1. **IAM Credential Report:** Use IAM credential reports to audit the permissions of users/accounts.
